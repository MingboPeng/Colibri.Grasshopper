# Colibri
### A design space exporter for Grasshopper.  


Colibri allows you to easily turn your GH definitions into Design Explorer-compatible data sets.  Run Colibri in Grasshopper, upload to Google Drive (or a private server), and voila - your design space in Design Explorer!

This project was first developed at the [2016 AEC Technology Hackathon at Thornton Tomasetti's offices in NYC](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-and-hackathon-2016/aec-technology-symposium-and-hackathon-2016-hackathon-info/).  CORE studio forked the project, and we are going to release Colibri as part of [TT Toolbox](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/tt-toolbox).
